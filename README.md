# Fractal

A mathematical research project about the so-called self-similar sets.

## About

This is an interactive notebook about brief introduction to the world of mathematics from a surprisingly different perspective. Intended as an individual research project, this explainer aims to bring the reader on a journey to a new geometry that is closely related to our everyday life.

Some recommended prerequisites include:

1. Set Theory
2. Linear Algebra
3. Measure Theory
4. Analytic Geometry
5. Python Programming (optional)

## Usage

This Jupyter notebook is written alternatingly between HTML texts with MathJax typesetting (called **markdown cells**) and Python lines for examples and visualisations (called **code cells**). Note that the explainer is made to be compatible with Colaboratory by Google, hence it is recommended to use this platform in order to get the program runs smoothly.

The markdown cells can be read solely as lecture note without understanding the contents of the code cells which is used for visualisation purpose. However, having some programming background has an upperhand, namely one can tweak the parameters in some indicated code lines (those with comments) to play around the pictures as experiment and it can help with the better understanding.

## Help

The project is maintained by the administrator at the moment. Still, any ideas and suggestions are warmly welcomed through email in the description.
